     <h2>History Of Toguna</h2>
<section class="History">

        <div class="aboutContainer">
    <p>Toguna is a comapny that started in 1992, owned by a lady called Rose. Her love of colors was so profound it was the one that led her into opening Toguna.<br>
       The employees she had were mostly encouraged by her love of colors, the company first had one employee for about two months. So Rose and her one employee were <br>
       not discouraged by their number rather they still were focusing on their mission which was to " Make the World know What Colors are capable of doing". Their <br>
       vision was parallel to their mission, which was "Colors can change the attitude of any thing", they wanted to see the vision in action. Thier target audience was <br>
       Fashion lovers and House owners.
    <br>
        Toguna's use of colors became more broad in such a way that, they expanded their application of colours.<br>
        The concept and love of colours wasn't enough to make them reach their vission and mission. So by expanding, <br>
        they now started to be more involved in art It's self than colours, by manifacturing goods such as chairs,<br>
        masks, shields etc...

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
 <section class="vission">

    <div class="VissionContainer">
    <p>Let's first disscus what a vision is, it is a clear goal or guide that people have, almost similar to a dream. It's what defines a human, so us as Toguna have the vissions <br>
        below... <br><br>
        
            Colors can change the attitude of anything. <br>
            Take for instance a house, ahouse can be old and not so good looking, but with a touch of colours and art inside the house, it has the potential of being a life giving place.
