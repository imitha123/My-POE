    <hr>
    <p>Toguna is a comapny that started in 1992, owned by a lady called Lara. Her love of colors was so profound it was the one that led her into opening Toguna.<br>
       The employees she had were mostly encouraged by her love of colors, the company first had one employee for about two months. So Lara and her one employee were <br>
       not discouraged by their number rather they still were focusing on their mission which was to " Make the World know What Colors are capable of doing". Their <br>
       vision was parallel to their mission, which was "Colors can change the attitude of any thing", they wanted to see the vision in action. Thier target audience was <br>
       Fashion lovers and House owners.
    </p>
   
    <p>

        Toguna's use of colors became more broad in such a way that, they expanded their application of colours.<br>
        The concept and love of colours wasn't enough to make them reach their vission and mission. So by expanding <br>
        they now started to be more involved in art It's self than colours, by manifacturing goods such as chairs,<br>
        masks, shields etc... 

    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Make the World know What Colors are capable of doing</li>
        <li>By the above qoute we mean, colors have an effect on what they are on and can make unseemingly good views to better views than how they were</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Vission</h2>

    <p>Let's first disscus what a vission is, it is a clear goal or guide that people have, almost similar to a dream. It's what defines a human, so us as Toguna have the vission that <br>
    that keeps us busy below...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Colors can change the attitude of any thing</li>
        <li>Take for instance a house, ahouse can be old and not so good looking, but with a touch of colours and art inside the house, it has the potential of being a life giving place.</li>
    </ul>
